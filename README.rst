Scrapes good music off Reddit, makes a spotify playlist

Installation and Usage
----------------------
via pip:
~~~~~~~~~~
.. code-block:: bash

    pip install listentoeverything

via source:
~~~~~~~~~~~
.. code-block:: bash

    git clone git@github.com:happykhan/listentoeverything.git
    cd listentoeverything
    pip install -r requirements.txt

Then run:
~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: bash

    python listentoeverything/cli.py --config_file <config_file.yml>


Configuration
-------------
You will need to sign up to the Spotify API and reddit API.

* https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/
* https://www.reddit.com/dev/api/

They will issue you with various authorisation keys which you need to
specify in the config file (default location is ~/.listen).

.. code-block:: yaml

    reddit:
       client_id: <Your key>
       client_secret: <Your key>
       user_agent: listenonspotify
       username: <Your reddit username>
       password: <Your pass>
    spotify:
       username: <Your spotify username>
       scope: playlist-modify-public
       client_id: <Your key>
       client_secret: <Your key>
       redirect_uri: http://localhost/



Spotify login
-------------
Spotify requires users to authorise 3rd party programs through the website.
Normally the first time you run this script it will open a web browser and redirect you
to spotify, where a user would need to click authorise. Then it will come back to
a redirect URL. As this isn't a website, I just send it back to localhost.

.. image:: docs/spotify_login.png

The script will want to know what the URL was, including the code. So copy this
from the address bar and paste in the prompt.

.. image:: docs/spotify_token.png

The token will be cached for a while so you do not need to do this every time.
